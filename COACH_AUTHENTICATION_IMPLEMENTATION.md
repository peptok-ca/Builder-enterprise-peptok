## User Experience Flow

### Unauthenticated User Journey:

1. **Visits /coaches** → Sees limited coach cards with "Limited" badges
2. **Views information banner** → Understands they need to sign in for full access
3. **Clicks "Sign In to Contact"** → Redirected to login page
4. **Clicks "View Limited Profile"** → Sees basic coach profile
5. **Sees authentication prompts** → Encouraged to create account

### Authenticated User Journey:

1. **Visits /coaches** → Sees complete coach information
2. **No authentication banners** → Seamless browsing experience
3. **Clicks "View Full Profile"** → Access to complete coach details
4. **Full contact options** → Can book sessions and message coaches

## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Context Integration

```typescript
// CoachDirectory.tsx
const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth();

// Pass authentication state to components
<CoachCard
  coach={coach}
  isAuthenticated={isAuthenticated}
  showLimitedDetails={!isAuthenticated}
/>
```

### Conditional Rendering Examples

```typescript
// Limited bio
{shouldShowLimited
  ? `${coach.bio?.substring(0, 100)}${coach.bio?.length > 100 ? '...' : ''}`
  : coach.bio
}

// Authentication-based buttons
{isAuthenticated ? (
  <Button>Book Session</Button>
) : (
  <Button asChild><a href="/login">Sign In to Book Session</a></Button>
)}
```

### Information Banners

```typescript
// Directory-level notice
{!isAuthenticated && (
  <Alert className="mb-8 border-blue-200 bg-blue-50">
    <Info className="h-4 w-4 text-blue-600" />
    <AlertDescription className="text-blue-800">
      <strong>Limited View:</strong> You're viewing limited coach profiles...
    </AlertDescription>
  </Alert>
)}
```

## UI/UX Enhancements

### Visual Indicators

- **"Limited" Badge:** Clear indication of restricted view
- **Lock Icons:** Used consistently for protected content
- **Information Alerts:** Blue-themed notices for authentication requirements
- **Blurred/Hidden Sections:** Contact information clearly marked as restricted

### Call-to-Action Buttons

- **Primary:** "Sign In to Book Session" (prominent blue)
- **Secondary:** "Create Account" (outline style)
- **Tertiary:** "View Limited Profile" (ghost/link style)

### Progressive Disclosure

- Users can browse coaches without registration
- Clear value proposition for creating an account
- Smooth transition from limited to full access

## Benefits

✅ **Improved Conversion:** Users can explore before committing to registration
✅ **Clear Value Proposition:** Shows what they gain by signing in
✅ **SEO Friendly:** Public coach listings improve search visibility
✅ **User-Friendly:** No hard barriers, gentle encouragement to register
✅ **Security:** Sensitive information protected behind authentication
✅ **Flexible Access:** Works for both marketing and functional use cases

## Route Configuration

```typescript
// Public routes (no ProtectedRoute wrapper)
<Route path="/coaches" element={<CoachDirectory />} />
<Route path="/coaches/:id" element={<CoachProfile />} />
```

Both routes are publicly accessible but provide differentiated experiences based on authentication status.

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Unauthenticated Access

- Coach directory loads with limited cards
- Information banner displays correctly
- Limited profile view works
- Authentication prompts function

### ✅ Authenticated Access

- Full coach directory with complete information
- No authentication banners
- Complete profile access
- All booking/contact features available

### ✅ Authentication Transitions

The implementation successfully provides a public coach directory with authentication-gated premium features, encouraging user registration while maintaining accessibility.
