# Company Admin Authorization Fix

## Issue

Company admins were seeing activities and data from all companies instead of being restricted to their own company's data only.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Wrong API Service Usage**: Dashboard pages were using `api.getMentorshipRequests()` instead of `apiEnhanced.getMentorshipRequests()`
2. **Missing Authorization Logic**: The regular `api` service doesn't have built-in company filtering
3. **Sample Data Issues**: localStorage sample data used a hardcoded company ID that all users would see

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Dashboard Pages to Use apiEnhanced

**Fixed Pages:**

- `src/pages/CompanyDashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/EmployeeDashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/EnterpriseDashboard.tsx`
- `src/pages/mentorship/MentorshipRequestDetails.tsx`

**Before:**

```typescript
// No company filtering - shows all data
const requests = await api.getMentorshipRequests();
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Automatically filters by company for company_admin users
const requests = await apiEnhanced.getMentorshipRequests();
```

### 2. Enhanced Authorization in apiEnhanced Service

The `apiEnhanced.getMentorshipRequests()` method already had proper authorization logic:

```typescript
// Role-based filtering in apiEnhanced
if (user.userType === "coach") {
  queryParams.append("coachId", user.id);
} else if (user.userType === "company_admin" && user.companyId) {
  queryParams.append("companyId", user.companyId); // ✅ Company filtering
}

// For localStorage fallback
if (user.userType === "company_admin" && user.companyId) {
  allRequests = allRequests.filter(
    (req: MentorshipRequest) => req.companyId === user.companyId,
  ); // ✅ Company filtering
}
```

### 3. Fixed Sample Data Initialization

**Before:**

```typescript
private initializeLocalStorage(): void {
  const sampleRequests = [{
    companyId: "default-company-id", // ❌ Same for all users
    // ...
  }];
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
private initializeLocalStorageForUser(userCompanyId?: string): void {
  const sampleRequests = [{
    companyId: userCompanyId || "default-company-id", // ✅ User's company
    // ...
  }];
}
```

### 4. Authorization Check Function

The existing `checkAuthorization` function in `apiEnhanced` provides comprehensive access control:

```typescript
const checkAuthorization = (
  requiredRoles?: string[],
  resourceOwnerId?: string,
) => {
  // Role verification
  if (requiredRoles && !requiredRoles.includes(currentUser.userType)) {
    throw new Error("Insufficient permissions");
  }

  // Resource owner check for company admins
  if (resourceOwnerId && currentUser.userType !== "platform_admin") {
    const hasAccess =
      currentUser.id === resourceOwnerId ||
      currentUser.companyId === resourceOwnerId ||
      (currentUser.userType === "company_admin" &&
        currentUser.companyId === resourceOwnerId);

    if (!hasAccess) {
      throw new Error("Access denied - you can only access your own resources");
    }
  }
};
```

## Components Already Using Proper Authorization

Several components were already correctly implemented:

✅ **AnalyticsDashboard**: Uses `apiEnhanced.getCompanyRequests()` with proper filtering

✅ **Company-specific APIs**:

- `getCompanyCoaches()` - Filters by company
- `getCompanyRequests()` - Filters by company
- `getAnalytics()` - Automatically adds company filter for company admins

✅ **Team Invitations**: Properly filtered by company in `getTeamInvitations()`

## Benefits

✅ **Data Isolation**: Company admins now only see their own company's data

✅ **Security**: Prevents unauthorized access to other companies' information

✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Both API and localStorage fallbacks respect company boundaries

✅ **Performance**: Reduced data transfer by filtering at the source

✅ **User Experience**: Relevant data only, no confusion from other companies' activities

## User Type Access Matrix

| User Type        | Data Access                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `platform_admin` | All companies (unrestricted)                      |
| `company_admin`  | Own company only (filtered by `user.companyId`)   |
| `coach`          | Own sessions/clients only (filtered by `user.id`) |
| `team_member`    | Own team/sessions only (filtered by context)      |

## Testing Verification

### Company Admin Isolation Test

1. **Login as Company Admin A** (companyId: "comp_001")

   - Dashboard shows only comp_001 mentorship requests
   - Analytics shows only comp_001 metrics
   - Team members list shows only comp_001 employees

2. **Login as Company Admin B** (companyId: "comp_002")

   - Dashboard shows only comp_002 mentorship requests
   - No visibility into comp_001 data
   - Separate team member lists

3. **Login as Platform Admin**
   - Can see all companies' data
   - No filtering restrictions

### API Endpoint Verification

```typescript
// Company Admin API calls are automatically filtered:
GET /mentorship-requests?companyId=comp_001  // ✅ Company filtering
GET /team/invitations?companyId=comp_001     // ✅ Company filtering
GET /analytics?companyId=comp_001            // ✅ Company filtering
```

## Migration Notes

- **No Breaking Changes**: Platform admins retain full access
- **Immediate Effect**: Company admins now see only relevant data
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing data structure unchanged
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Better security without losing functionality

The fix ensures that company admins have a secure, isolated view of their company's mentorship activities while maintaining full functionality within their authorized scope.
