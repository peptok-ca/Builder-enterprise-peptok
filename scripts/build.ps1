.SYNOPSIS
    Build the Peptok coaching platform containers

.DESCRIPTION
    This script builds Docker containers for the Peptok platform.
    It supports both development and production builds.

.PARAMETER Environment
    The environment to build for (development or production). Default is development.

.PARAMETER NoCache
    Build without using cache

.PARAMETER Parallel
    Build containers in parallel (faster but uses more resources)

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\build.ps1
    Build for development environment

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\build.ps1 -Environment production -NoCache
    Build for production without cache

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\build.ps1 -Parallel
    Build with parallel processing
